create an object called "TallyMode" that can be 
initialized with an array of integers. 

There is one method called "GetModes".

Note: the Mode is the value that occurs most often
in the array. If there are two values that occur
the same number of times - the data array is called
bimodal and both modes are returned in an array.

The array is formed in the following way. Each index
is considered the value, and the data at the index is
the frequency of that value. 

Ex: if the array is: 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 6, 2 
That array means that we have actual data of:
0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8

In this case getModes would return an array of 
 with the value 7 because 7 has a higher frequency
 then any other. If two values tied for high frequency,
 the array would contain both values.
 
Problem 1: write the getModes function.

Problem 2: write a function called "getKth" that returns
the value of the Kth data point. For example, if the client
called getKth(3), the value returned would be 1 (1 relative).
If the client called getKth(9), 3 would be returned.
